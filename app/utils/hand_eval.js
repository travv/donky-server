/**
 * These functions are designed to evaluate Texas Hold'em poker hands.
 * The core data structure is the `hand` object, which contains all parameters to evaluate and compare hands.
 * The core usage of this set of functions is to take the information about the cards on the table and return an ordered list of players' hands from best to worst.
 *
 * Whenever a function parameter requires an array of "two-char card strings", those specifically are as follows:
 *  The first character of each two-char card string must be a card rank, from the set (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, T, J, Q, K, A).
 *  The second character of each two-char card string must be a card suit, from the set (s, h, c, d).
 *  Note that all ranks are capitalized, and all suits are lowercase.
 *  Each valid two-char card string represents a single card. Here are some examples: 'Th', '3d', 'Qc', '2d', '9s'
 *
